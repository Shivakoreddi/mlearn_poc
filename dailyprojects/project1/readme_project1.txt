Real-Time ML Project: Live Prediction of Delivery Delays Using Distance & Weather
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:
Build a linear regression model (from scratch using NumPy) to predict delivery delay (in minutes) based on:

Distance (in km)

Temperature (Â°C)

Rainfall (mm)

Wind speed (km/h)

Youâ€™ll simulate or use a real dataset (or even stream fake live data), and apply:

Gradient descent to optimize weights

Mean squared error for loss

Taylor expansion to visualize local error approximation

Projections to understand the fit

Z-scores to remove outliers

Confidence intervals to quantify your modelâ€™s uncertainty

ðŸ§± Inputs (Features):
distance_km: Float

temp_C: Float

rain_mm: Float

wind_kmph: Float

ðŸŽ¯ Target Output:
delay_minutes: Float
